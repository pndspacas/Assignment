# Bugs & Tricks

## Bugs

1. **Scrolling Behavior Issue:**
   Clicking on "Top 10 Revenue by Year," opening and closing the description, and then resetting the page leads to loss of scrolling behavior.
   - **Quick Fix:** Refresh the page.
   - **Alternative:** Click reset, then "Top 10 Revenue," open and close the description; it should resume the expected behavior.

2. **More Movies Loading:**
   The "More Movies" feature fetches data only upon mouse hover, not triggering data loading via scrolling.

## Tricks

1. **Top 10 Revenue Scroll Disablement:**
   Both "Top 10 Revenue" and "Top 10 Revenue by Year" disable scrolling while displaying the top 10 and prevent fetching additional data.

2. **Table Icon and Scroll Disablement:**
   The Table Icon disables scrolling to maintain the display of descriptions at a consistent height for better visualization.

3. **Description Icon and Scroll Enablement:**
   Clicking the Description Icon enables scrolling to view the list or fetch more data.

4. **Fixed Filter Container:**
   The Filter Container remains fixed while scrolling, allowing data filtering from any position on the page.

5. **Max Amount Indicator - Arrow Icon:**
   An Arrow Icon appears when the data reaches its maximum limit, enabling a quick scroll to the top of the page.
